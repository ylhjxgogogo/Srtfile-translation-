1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Showing

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
a loading indicator is pretty straight forward. So this query object

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
has another useful property that is is loading.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We can grab that and then here we can say

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
if is loading we can return a

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
paragraph and say loading. We can also render a spinner.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Now let's test our application. So back in the browser, refresh, you can

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
see loading appearing pretty quickly. We can simulate a slow connection

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
by going to the network tab and applying a

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
throttling. So here we can simulate a fast 3G connection.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now let's refresh.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's going to happen in a second.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Alright, here's loading and then we get the data. So this is the beauty of

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
react query. We no longer have to declare separate state variables for our

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
data, error and the loading state. Everything is well taken care of.
