00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Alright, we just wrapped up the first part of this section.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,960
In the next 45 minutes session, we'll be covering a whole bunch of cool topics including creating

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,160
mutations, handling mutation errors, implementing optimistic updates, creating custom mutation

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,660
hooks, and building reusable services for querying and mutating data.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,120
But before we jump into all that, let's take a quick break.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,280
You've been doing great so far, so take a well-deserved 10-15 minute break.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,960
Go for a walk, grab a coffee, or whatever you like.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,880
Once you feel refreshed and energized, come back and let's continue this journey.
