1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
here's our current implementation. Now there is a problem here, can you spot it?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Pause the video and think about it for a few seconds.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here's the answer, we don't have separation of concerns,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
because our querying logic has leaked inside our component.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now to separate these concerns, we should extract the querying logic

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
into a separate reusable hook. So, back to our project,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
let's create a new folder called hooks,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
here we add a new file called use

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
todoes.ts. In this file, first we define

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
a function called use todoes, and then export

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it as a default object. Now,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
back to our component, first let's grab this function

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and move it to our hook,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
now, here we need to import axis, as well as

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the todo interface. Now I want to move that interface into this module,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so, back to our component, let's grab it from here

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and move it over.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay, let's save the changes,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
so our code is reformatted, good. Now, in this hook we should

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
call the query hook and return a query object, so

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
back to our component, let's clean up our code,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
alright, this is where we call the query hook, so let's grab

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
this piece of code and move it

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to our new hook. So here we add a return statement

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and return this query object straight away.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now let's import use query from tanstack slash

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
react query, good, we are done with this hook, so now

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
back to our component, on the top, to get todoes,

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
all we have to do is call use todoes, as simple

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
as that. Now our component has a single responsibility,

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
is purely concerned with markup, it doesn't know how the data

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
should be fetched. If somewhere else we have another component that

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
requires the list of todoes, in that component we can use our new

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
hook. So we're done here, the last step is remove

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
these unnecessary import statements.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So now our component is much simpler and easier to maintain and debug.
